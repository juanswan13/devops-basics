# Linux Basics

Most of our day is spent in front of a GNU/Linux terminal configuring stuff, debugging, reading logs, etc. You don’t need to be the greatest expert in an operating system, but you must feel comfortable typing commands in front of a terminal and you must understand the basics about how GNU/Linux works.  

 
**Note:** We are tool agnostic, so, feel free to choose the operating system that you want (e.g., Windows server). However, GNU/Linux is the most widely used operating system around the world; most of the systems that you’ll encounter during your career (at least in this decade) are going to be GNU/Linux servers.
